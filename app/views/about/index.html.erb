  <h1>Examing the Life and Works of George Frideric Handel</h1>
  <h2>Adult Education Seminar @ the Newberry Library</h2>
  <h2>February 20-April 16</h2>
  <p>George Frideric Handel’s earliest biographer described him as a man with a “noble spirit of independency.” Today, however, we might describe Handel as a hothead. Handel fought a duel with a leading German musician; he threatened to throw a soprano out a window; and he dodged authorities to realize the performance of his works. This class explores Handel’s colorful personality, adventurous life, and engaging operatic works, especially Agrippina (1709)––from his Italian period––and Giulio Cesare (1724)––from London.

  <p>The first two weeks provide students with a foundation for thinking about Handel, his cultural contexts, and his music. Specifically, the first class presents an overview of Handel’s biography, tracing his life in Germany, Italy, and England, and the second class offers a survey of the eighteenth-century theater––especially, the singers, audiences, and economies of the first Royal Academy of Music in London (1720-1728), for which Handel composed operas. Perhaps most important, this course begins with a presentation of tools needed for listening and musical analysis. Handel wrote music during the so-called baroque era, during which composers cultivated a large vocabulary of recognizable musical conventions that communicate affect and at times extra-musical meaning. Students will learn to listen for and recognize various baroque devices and the formal conventions that govern early eighteenth-century opera or opera seria.</p>
  <p>This course gives special emphasis to Handel’s operatic output. Handel wrote operas at every stage of his career, and thus, his operas provide a sense of the composer’s early, middle, and late style. His operas also challenge expectations of baroque opera: Handel’s oeuvre draws heavily from seventeenth-century idioms, while remaining relevant to contemporary cultural trends, historical events, and specific milieus. This course explores three operas in detail: Giulio Cesare (1724), an example of a relatively typical opera seria; Orlando (1733), one of Handel’s last operatic works and one that greatly departs from generic norms; and finally, Agrippina (1709), an early work, composed during Handel’s period in Italy. The course concludes with Agrippina because it offers a particularly interesting case for discussion of musical borrowing. Fifty of its fifty-five individual pieces come from pre-existent sources, and thus the work raises questions about compositional process, musical meaning, and ethics. This class concludes, then, with a reflection on the experience of listening to Handel in the eighteenth-century and our critical engagement with his works today.</p>
